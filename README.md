# To-Do-List
To do list that uses local storage so do not forget to delete your items from the list ^.^

Simple to-do-list that stores input data into your local storage so user will not lose data upon closing the webpage.
Check  Chrome Dev-tools > Application > Storage > Local Storage  
You should find an empty array or an array if you already passed data into the list.

- HTML elements created by JS createElement()
- Elements are append to parent elements
- Completed - Trash button onclick solved via event capturing
- From local storage items are writtem via forEach loop using the same methodology as in the first point, createElement().
Difference is the passed in inputTodo is now todos(array) from storage.
